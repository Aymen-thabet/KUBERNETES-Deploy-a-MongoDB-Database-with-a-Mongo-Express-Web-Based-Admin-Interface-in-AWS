This is the overall project Architecture :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e3ae24b-7498-494b-83b9-7773716f2f6b)

We will be using Kubeadm cluster on 3 EC2 instaces on which I have CSI installed already !  

I will Also be using MobaXterm Cli to interact with the master Node on AWS !


First thing to do is to create the MongoDB secret that will contain username and password of the mongo database, then i will create the StorageClass , pvc to describe the EBS volume on AWS 
then I Created the deployement of the MongoDB which will also create automatically the EBS volume on AWS and the PV .
Later we will create a MongoDB service and it will be a ClusterIP type to assure inner connection of the MongoDB 
Second Step : I created a Config Map to attach both apps to the MongoDB , which will connect to the MongoDB svc .
Then Create a MongoExpress deployment and attach it to the ConfigMap .
Finally a service for the MongoExpress to expose it and making it possible to connect to it so the svc need to be a LoadBalancer ( Or nodePort).

*All machines have attached role to use EBS already*

First : I created a directory for the project and create a secret in it , and Encrypting the username and the password and putting them in the secret yaml file :

Then Creating a StorageClass :

Then Creating PVC :

*Volume is pending because the VolumeBindingMode = WaitForFirstConsumer*

Then Creating a Deploymenet : 

Upon applying the yaml file of the deploy , the PV will be created and the EBS volume on AWS will be created automatically also : 

The Deployment will be pointing on the username and password from the secret yaml file

after some minutes the deployment is ready

And a Pod is created ofc :

And Also an EBS volume is created automatically :

Note that the PVC is Bound now :
